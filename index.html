    <h1 class="me">Who Am I?</h1> 
  
   <p> Hi, I’m Jhamiya Jones, a dedicated professional from Atlanta, Georgia,
     with a passion for growth, creativity, and problem-solving.
     Above all, I am a proud mother to a beautiful daughter, 
     who inspires me every day to strive for balance, excellence, and self-care in all aspects of life. 
     Family is at the core of everything I do, 
     and I firmly believe that maintaining a sense of harmony between personal and professional 
     ambitions is essential for long-term success.</p>
    
    <p>My background is deeply rooted in human development, education, and organization. 
    With a Bachelor of Science in Human Development and Family Sciences from the University of Georgia, I have cultivated a strong foundation in understanding people, problem-solving, and adaptability. 
    Throughout my career, I have gained experience in childcare, special education, case management, customer service, and operational support—skills that have shaped my ability to work efficiently, think critically, and communicate effectively.</p>
    
    <p>Now, I am expanding my expertise into the world of technology, with a focus on software engineering. 
    I have beginner experience in HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and wireframing, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in web development and programming. 
    My ability to organize, analyze, and create user-friendly experiences makes me a strong candidate for the tech industry.</p>
    <p> As I continue this journey, I look forward to growing, learning, and creating meaningful digital experiences. If you’d like to connect, collaborate, or follow my progress, feel free to contact me!
    </p>
