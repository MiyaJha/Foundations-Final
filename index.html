    <h1>Who Am I?</h1> 

   <p> Hi, I’m Jhamiya Jones, a dedicated professional from Atlanta, Georgia,
     with a passion for growth, creativity, and problem-solving.
     Above all, I am a proud mother to a beautiful daughter, 
     who inspires me every day to strive for balance, excellence, and self-care in all aspects of life. 
     Family is at the core of everything I do, 
     and I firmly believe that maintaining a sense of harmony between personal and professional 
     ambitions is essential for long-term success.</p>

    <p>Now, I am expanding my expertise into the world of technology, with a focus on software engineering. 
    I have beginner experience in HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and wireframing, and I am eager to continue developing my skills in web development and programming. 
    My ability to organize, analyze, and create user-friendly experiences makes me a strong candidate for the tech industry.</p>
